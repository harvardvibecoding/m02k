Continuing on from the prior unit, this project contains the resulting output of the instructor's AI when prompted for column mapping UI in `people_headcount_app.py`. The learner may optionally start from here when prompting for an impact score display.

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run people_headcount_app.py
```
